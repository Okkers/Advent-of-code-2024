# Advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my solutions for the 2024 Advent of code! 

### Requirements 
This reposiory was made with the sole ofcus of using numpy - any recent version will suffice. If you don't have numpy installed, create a 
virtual environment:
```
python -m venv NAMEOFVENV
NAMEOFVENV/scripts/activate
```
and install numpy:
```
pip install numpy
```
### Usage
To run the solutions, add your required input.txt into the desired day (i.e. add input for day1 to days/day1/). 
Then, run ```python main.py``` and input the desired day of solving.
